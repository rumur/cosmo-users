## Introduction

**Transformer** and **DataTransformer** interfaces facilitate the transformation of data from one format to another.

## Adapters

At this moment we support only one adapter: `FractalAdapter` which allows to use [Fractal](https://fractal.thephpleague.com/) library for data transformation.
